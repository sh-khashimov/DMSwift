/// The `PostProcessing` protocol is used to create post-processes that can be used after the file has been downloaded.
/// For example, unzip .zip files or create image thumbnails.
///
/// The implementation requirements for post-processing are as follows.
/// For the correct operation, the object that is inherited from `PostProcessing` must be *Value Types (struct)*.
/// Under the **supportedFileExtensions** parameter, specify a list of file extensions over which post-processing can be performed.
/// Use the **prepare** method to get the data you need to start post-processing.
/// Describe the logic behind post-processing in the **process** method.
/// Call **onComplete**, after the completion of post-processing.

    ///   - fileStorage: Use this parameter if you need to save or delete a file.
    ///   - filename: Local filename.
    ///   - fileExtention: File extention.
    ///   - sourceLocation: The reference to the source file on which post-processing should be performed.
